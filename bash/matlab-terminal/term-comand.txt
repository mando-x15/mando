nohup matlab -nodesktop -nosplash -r maxE /dev/null 2> output.txt

% nohup is used to keep matlab from messing up the terminal/stream



%%example code:

clear all;
close all;


energy = importdata('energy.txt');
int = energy(:,4);
[C,I] = max(int);

fprintf('%f\n',C)
fprintf('%i\n',I)

%be sure to output exactly to a specific file -- not to the screen as shown above -- will show the matlab copyright/logo

quit  %need to have both quit and exit in script
exit
